# hex-color-project
A project similar to the background color change project. This time it includes a random hex color output along with the backgrounds. HTML and CSS were provided, but I did the JavaScript myself. I used variables, an array, a for loop, a function, and the DOM to accomplish the end results.

Project taken from www.jsbeginners.com
